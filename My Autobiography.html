        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Mary Lis B. Pacaldo, and I was born on August 11 2007. 
        I am currently 18 years old. I come from a loving and supportive family that has always been my greatest source of strength.
        We are six in the family, my parents, my three sisters, and me.
        Being the youngest among my siblings has taught me a lot about responsibility, patience, and teamwork.
        My sisters and I are very close, we share everything, from laughter to late-night talks.
        Even though we sometimes argue, our bond always grows stronger after every misunderstanding.
        My parents have always guided us with love and wisdom, reminding us to stay humble and kind.
        At home, we enjoy spending time together, especially during weekends and special occasions.
        I am truly grateful to have a family that supports me in everything I do.
        As a student, I take my studies seriously because I want to make my family proud.</p>

        <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
        <p>I spent my childhood in Cordova, where I spent most of my early years surrounded by my loving family. 
        My early life was filled with happy memories of playing with friends and discovering new things each day.
        As a child, I was naturally curious and eager to learn about the world around me.
        I started my education at Day-as Elementary School, where I first learned the importance of hard work and discipline.
        My teachers were kind and patient, and they inspired me to always do my best in everything. And when I moved on to high school, I became more focused on my studies and personal goals.
        High school life was full of challenges, but it also gave me opportunities to grow and discover my strengths.
        I made wonderful friends and learned the value of teamwork and perseverance.There were times when I faced difficulties, but with the support of my family and teachers, I never gave up.
        After graduating from high school, I decided to continue my journey by entering college.
        I am now studying at Lapu-Lapu City College, taking up BIT COMPTECH.
        College life is very different from high school, but it teaches me independence and responsibility.
        I've learned how to manage my time, balance my studies, and handle pressure more effectively. Every day in college is a new opportunity to gain knowledge and improve myself.
        I have met new friends who share the same goals and dreams, which makes my college experience even more meaningful. So, I am grateful for every experience that has shaped who I am today, a determined and hopeful college student striving to achieve my dreams.</p>

        I dream of becoming someone who can support my family and live comfortably.
        To reach these goals, I know I need to study regularly and stay focused.
        I plan to manage my time better so I can balance schoolwork and hobbies. Though I face challenges sometimes, I try not to give up and keep moving forward.
